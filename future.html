      <h1>FUTURE ASPIRATION</h1>
      <P>"I have discovered in life that there are ways of getting almost anywhere you want to go, if you really want to go."- Langston Hughes. My one goal for the future is to be happy regardless of what I choose to do. I want to be satisfied with my decisions, to be able to accept and forgive, and most of all to be able to live up to the expectations I have for myself. I realize I cannot have others set my aspirations and dreams for me, I need to achieve things for myself. If I live my life for the people around me, I will never get a satisfaction for my life. I have to live my life fulfilled with my aspirations.</p>
        <p>My aspiration in life is to become the best in tech most especially in backend engineering, to travel and discover the world. I want to see all sorts of places in Australia, Canada and Kenya. Ever since I was in the university studying Hospitality and Tourism, I have known that I wanted to do: tavel the world! I have always been facsinated with exploring and finding out as much as I can about different cultures.</P>
          <p>Honestly, my passion and love for technology came from within me and what the world is becoming. It has always been something I have overlooked and now, I hink is the chance to do something which not only I, but future generations will appreciate. I always wondered how social media application such as Whatsapp, Instagram, Twitter, etc along with many other applicattions are built, operated, who are the genius behind it. This curiousity built up the passion to find out and embark on the journey of becoming one of the geniuses. I decided to reach out to one of the full stack developer I know to tell him about my interest in technology. He introduced me to a senior in the field he knows that is best and can mentor me. She told me to do research on various types on technology that is available. I found out what the people behind the building and operating of applications are called, and I decided to go on the journey of becoming a backend engineer.
          </p>
          <p>I have spent time watching youtube video of seniors of people that are already in the field, followed great people in the field on social media to know how they started their journey and how well they are doing now. I just got a scholarship into one of the best leading tech school in Africa, Altschool Africa. Altschool Africa is a digital based learning platform. It was founded in 2921 by Adewale Yusuf, Akintunde Sultan and Opeyemi Awoyemi. The school has students from Nigeria, Kenya, Ghana, Rwanda and the United Kingdom.The program at Altschool Africa is a one-year diploma course. The program is a blended learning approach consisting of virtual instructor led sessions as well as self-paced learning modules. I believe that with help of God, along side my committment,discipline and determination, I will be able to acieve my dream of becoming one of the backend engineer in Nigeria.</p>
